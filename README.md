## Description

linearmoney was created to make calculations and formatting with multiple currencies
in modern international applications easier and more reliable.

Key Features:

- Full support for arithmetic with monetary amounts in different currencies.
- Full support for non-destructive currency conversion.
- Full support for fractional currency rounding and fixed-point rounding.
- Full support for currency formatting and localization.
- No dependencies other than Python itself.
- Completely thread-safe.
- 100% Test and API Documentation coverage.

The linearmoney library takes a non-traditional approach to financial applications
by using linear algebra internally to ensure the correctness of monetary calculations
involving multiple currencies without passing this burden onto the programmer.
Understanding of linear algebra is not needed to use and understand the linearmoney
library, but an understanding of basic arithmetic with vectors is helpful for
understanding how the library works under the hood.

For a technical explanation of the motivation and philosophy behind linearmoney
as well as the complete pure-math model that defines the behaviors of the library, see
the [Linear Money Model](https://grammacc.github.io/linearmoney/linear_money_model.html) article.

linearmoney uses the amazing [Unicode CLDR-JSON](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json)
data to provide data-driven interfaces for currency rounding, formatting, and localization.

### Disclaimer

This is a pre-release piece of software. The library is stable and well-tested, but
some breaking changes will occur before the first stable release.
Please keep this in mind if choosing to use this library in production.
Version 1.0.0 will mark the first stable release.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PyPi is not allowing new user registration at this time, so this package is not
> available on the package index yet.
> For now, the package can only be built from source.

linearmoney requires Python >= 3.12

From PyPi:

```bash
pip install linearmoney
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrammAcc/linearmoney
cd linearmoney
poetry build
```

See the [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) docs if
you don't have poetry installed yet.

Then to install (virtual environment recommended):

```bash
pip install path/to/cloned/repo
```

## Basic Usage

```pycon
>>> import linearmoney as lm
>>> fo = lm.vector.forex({"base": "usd", "rates": {"jpy": 100}})
>>> sp = lm.vector.space(fo)
>>> cart = []
>>> milk_price = lm.vector.asset(4.32, 'usd', sp)
>>> cart.append(milk_price)
>>> eggs_price = lm.vector.asset(5.45, 'usd', sp)
>>> cart.append(eggs_price)
>>> sales_tax = 0.095
>>> subtotal = sum(cart)
>>> total = subtotal + (subtotal * sales_tax)
>>> total_usd = lm.vector.evaluate(total, "usd", fo)
>>> total_jpy = lm.vector.evaluate(total, "jpy", fo)
>>> usd = lm.data.currency("usd")
>>> jpy = lm.data.currency("jpy")
>>> en_US = lm.data.locale("en", "us")
>>> localized_total_usd = lm.scalar.l10n(total_usd, usd, en_US)
>>> localized_total_jpy = lm.scalar.l10n(total_jpy, jpy, en_US)
>>> print(localized_total_usd)
$10.70
>>> print(localized_total_jpy)

linearymoney uses a functional/procedural style where all objects are immutable, so
the code can become verbose compared to more idiomatic Python, but this also makes
the code more explicit and easier to test.

See the [Recipes](https://grammacc.github.io/linearmoney/recipes.html)
section of the user guide for
some examples of how to mitigate the verbosity of the library and other helpful patterns.
